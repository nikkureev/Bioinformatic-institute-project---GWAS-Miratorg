Warning: 65765 het. haploid genotypes present (see plink.hh ); many commands
treat these as missing.
Total genotyping rate in remaining samples is 0.989959.
2506 variants removed due to missing genotype data (--geno).
Warning: --hwe observation counts vary by more than 10%, due to the X
chromosome.  You may want to use a less stringent --hwe p-value threshold for X
chromosome variants.
--hwe: 145 variants removed due to Hardy-Weinberg exact test.
